Spatial data on the Web is becoming ubiquitous and voluminous with the rapid growth of location-based services, spatial technologies, dynamic location-based data and services published by different organizations. However, the heterogeneity and the peculiarities of spatial data, such as the use of different coordinate reference systems, make it difficult for data users, Web applications, and services to discover, interpret and use the information in the large and distributed system that is the Web. To make spatial data more effectively available, this paper summarizes the work of the joint W3C/OGC Working Group on Spatial Data on the Web that identifies 14 best practices for publishing spatial data on the Web. The paper extends that work by presenting the identified challenges and rationale for selection of the recommended best practices, framed by the set of principles that guided the selection. It describes best practices that are employed to enable publishing, discovery and retrieving (querying) spatial data on the Web, and identifies some areas where a best practice has not yet emerged." ;

        :hasAbstract    "In order for a web server to provide optimised content to different client devices it requires a description of the capabilities of the client known as the delivery context. In previous work we demonstrated DELI, an open-source library that allows Java servlets to resolve HTTP requests containing delivery context information in CC/PP or UAProf formats. Subsequently DELI has been incorporated into the Apache Cocoon XML publishing framework in order to demonstrate how delivery context information can be used in conjunction with content transformation via XSLT. During this work, it was found that it is cumbersome to match this information using constraints written in XPath. Furthermore there is no easy method of abstraction so that common sets of constraints may be reused in multiple stylesheets. This report describes an alternative mechanism for delivery context matching called capability classes (patent pending). This report outlines how to implement capability classes and how they may be applied to various content specialisation techniques such as content transformation, negotiation or generation. It also compares and contrasts capability classes with device classes and media queries." ;

The actual Web Services that will be used to satisfy the requester's goal are selected at run-time and, therefore, they are not known beforehand. As a consequence, determining whether the selected services can be trusted becomes an essential issue. In this paper, we propose the use of the Peertrust language to decide if trust can be established between the requester and the service provider. We add modelling elements to the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) in order to include trust information in the description of Semantic Web Services. In this scenario, we discuss different registry architectures and their implications for the matchmaking process. In addition, we present a matching algorithm for the trust policies introduced." ;

The QoS-sensitive approach complements the lossy nature of the transcoding operations. The decision engine will look for the best trade off among various parameters in order to reduce the loss of quality in various domains. Quantitative methods are suggested to measure the QoS of the content versions in various quality domains. Based on the particular user perception and other contextual information on the client capability, the network connection, and the requested content, the proposed negotiation algorithm will determine a content version with a good aggregate score. We have built a prototype document adaptation system for PDF documents to demonstrate the viability of our approach." ;

The protocol is designed for machine- to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and building automation.\n CoAP provides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet media types.

This mechanism allows IoT users to express and enforce their personal privacy preferences in a seamless manner while interacting with IoT deployments. A key contribution of the paper is that it addresses the privacy concerns of individual users as well as a group of users where privacy preferences of all individual users are combined into a group privacy profile to be negotiated with the IoT owner. In addition, the proposed mechanism satisfies the privacy requirements of the IoT deployment owner. Finally, the proposed privacy mechanism is agnostic to the actual IoT architecture and can be used over a user-managed, edge-managed or a cloud-managed IoT architecture. Prototypes of the proposed mechanism have been implemented for each of these three architectures, and the results show the capability of the protocol to negotiate privacy while adding insignificant time overhead." ;

        :hasAbstract    "Information Retrieval (IR) systems assist users in finding information from the myriad of information resources available on the Web. A traditional characteristic of IR systems is that if different users submit the same query, the system would yield the same list of results, regardless of the user. Personalised Information Retrieval (PIR) systems take a step further to better satisfy the user‚Äôs specific information needs by providing search results that are not only of relevance to the query but are also of particular relevance to the user who submitted the query. PIR has thereby attracted increasing research and commercial attention as information portals aim at achieving user loyalty by improving their performance in terms of effectiveness and user satisfaction. In order to provide a personalised service, a PIR system maintains information about the users and the history of their interactions with the system. This information is then used to adapt the users‚Äô queries or the results so that information that is more relevant to the users is retrieved and presented. This survey paper features a critical review of PIR systems, with a focus on personalised search. The survey provides an insight into the stages involved in building and evaluating PIR systems, namely: information gathering, information representation, personalisation execution, and system evaluation. Moreover, the survey provides an analysis of PIR systems with respect to the scope of personalisation addressed. The survey proposes a classification of PIR systems into three scopes: individualised systems, community-based systems, and aggregate-level systems. Based on the conducted survey, the paper concludes by highlighting challenges and future research directions in the field of PIR." ;

        :hasAbstract    "The RDF data model forms a cornerstone of the Semantic Web technology stack. Although there have been diÔ¨Äerent proposals for RDF serialization syntaxes, the underlying simple data model enables great Ô¨Çexibility which allows it to be successfully employed in many diÔ¨Äerent scenarios and to form the basis on which other technologies are developed. In order to apply an RDF-based approach in practice it is necessary to communicate the structure of the data that is being stored or represented. Data quality is of paramount importance for the acceptance of RDF as a data representation language and it must be enabled by the use of tools that can check if some data conforms to some speciÔ¨Åc structure. There have been several recent proposals for RDF validation languages like ShEx and SHACL. In this chapter, we describe both proposals and enumerate some challenges and trends that we foresee with regards to RDF validation. We devote more space to what we consider one of the main challenges, which is to compare ShEx and SHACL and to understand their underlying foundations. To that end, we propose an intermediate language and show how ShEx and SHACL can be converted to it." ;

Any IRI can take the place of a datatype IRI, but the specification only defines the precise meaning of a literal when the datatype IRI is among a predefined subset. Custom datatypes have reported use on the Web of Data, and show some advantages in representing some classical structures. Yet, their support by RDF processors is rare and implementation specific. In this paper, we first present the minimal set of functions that should be defined in order to make a custom datatype usable in query answering and reasoning. Based on this, we discuss solutions that would enable: (i) data publishers to publish the definition of arbitrary custom datatypes on the Web, and (ii) generic RDF processor or SPARQL query engine to discover custom datatypes on-the-fly, and to perform operations on them accordingly. Finally, we detail a concrete solution that targets arbitrarily complex custom datatypes, we overview its implementation in Jena and ARQ, and we report the results of an experiment on a real world DBpedia use case." ;

        :hasAbstract    "The introduction of the concept of QoS has led to an extension of the traditional concepts of service and service specification. However, the design of QoS support is usually done without a systematic approach, leading to concepts of QoS support ranging from basic QoS monitoring capabilities to hard real-time guarantees. In more advanced QoS support, intermediate layers should be designed in a way that enables the masking or controlled handling of sporadic QoS violations. To implement this degradation path support across multiple layers, a negotiation of preferred and supportable failure semantics is a requirement. To realize these advanced QoS support features, not only new QoS control mechanisms within the layers have to be developed but the semantics of QoS negotiation protocols between layers must be better understood and subsequently extended. A framework formally based on set theory and relations is presented that allows the specification of QoS hierarchies including a well-defined failure type model. The framework supports the development of QoS negotiation protocols and can be used as a formal base for a structured system analysis." ;

        :hasAbstract    "Dereferencing a URI returns a representation of the current state of the resource identified by that URI. But, on the Web representations of prior states of a resource are also available, for example, as resource versions in Content Management Systems or archival resources in Web Archives such as the Internet Archive. This paper introduces a resource versioning mechanism that is fully based on HTTP and uses datetime as a global version indicator. The approach allows \"follow your nose\" style navigation both from the current time-generic resource to associated time-specific version resources as well as among version resources. The proposed versioning mechanism is congruent with the Architecture of the World Wide Web, and is based on the Memento framework that extends HTTP with transparent content negotiation in the datetime dimension. The paper shows how the versioning approach applies to Linked Data, and by means of a demonstrator built for DBpedia, it also illustrates how it can be used to conduct a time-series analysis across versions of Linked Data descriptions." ;

The method selectively pre-adapts a subset of content variants and leaves the generation of the residue to dynamic content adaptation with this pre-adapted subset as an input. We prove bounds regarding the optimality of the algorithm employed. The proposed model creates a collaborative environment across the components of client, proxy and server, based on which we study the distribution of adaptation complexity across these components. We use simulation to verify the projected benefits. The method has been successfully implemented in a trial PDF document content adaptation system." ;

        :hasAbstract    "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have proliferated on the Web since the introduction of knowledge panels to Google search in 2012. KGs are large data-first graph databases with weak inference rules and weakly-constraining data schemes. SHACL, the Shapes Constraint Language, is a W3C recommendation for expressing constraints on graph data as shapes. SHACL shapes serve to validate a KG, to underpin manual KG editing tasks and to offer insight into KG structure. \nWe introduce Inverse Open Path (IOP) rules, a predicate logic formalism which presents specific shapes in the form of paths over connected entities. Although IOP rules express simple shape patterns, they can be augmented with minimum cardinality constraints and also used as a building block for more complex shapes, such as trees and other rule patterns. We define quality measures for IOP rules and propose a novel method to learn high-quality rules from KGs. We show how to build high-quality tree shapes from the IOP rules. Our learning method, SHACLEARNER, is adapted from a state-of-the-art embedding-based open path rule learner (OPRL).\nWe evaluate SHACLEARNER on some real-world massive KGs, including YAGO2s (4M facts), DBpedia 3.8 (11M facts), and Wikidata (8M facts). The experiments show SHACLEARNER can learn informative and intuitive shapes from massive KGs effectively. Our experiments show the learned shapes are diverse in both structural features such as depth and width, and in quality measures." ;

Several standards have been proposed for content negotiation including HTTP/1.1 server based content negotiation, media feature sets and most recently the Composite Capabilities / Preferences Profile (CC/PP). CC/PP, unlike the other two methods, is only concerned with the client profile and does not specify mechanisms for describing alternate versions of content or matching client profiles to content descriptions. In order to better understand how CC/PP may be used this report describes an implementation of HTTP/1.1-style content negotiation that uses CC/PP client profiles and RDF content descriptions. The Jena RDF Framework developed at HP Labs is used to implement a negotiation algorithm similar to that used by Apache Web Server. As CC/PP is compatible with the forthcoming Wireless Access Protocol (WAP) User Agent Profile (UAProf) these techniques are applicable to the next generation of WAP devices. This is demonstrated using an example profile taken from the current WAP Forum documentation." ;

A resource is not necessarily accessible via the Internet; e.g., human beings, corporations, and bound books in a library can also be resources. Likewise, abstract concepts can be resources, such as the operators and operands of a mathematical equation, the types of a relationship (e.g., \"parent\" or \"employee\"), or numeric values (e.g., zero, one, and infinity)."@en ;

Specifically, SHACL documents are collections of constraints that enforce particular shapes on an RDF graph. Previous work on the topic has provided theoretical and practical results for the validation problem, but did not consider the standard decision problems of satisfiability and containment, which are crucial for verifying the feasibility of the constraints and important for design and optimization purposes. In this paper, we undertake a thorough study of the different features of SHACL by providing a translation to a new first-order language, called Open image in new window , that precisely captures the semantics of SHACL w.r.t. satisfiability and containment. We study the interaction of SHACL features in this logic and provide the detailed map of decidability and complexity results of the aforementioned decision problems for different SHACL sublanguages. Notably, we prove that both problems are undecidable for the full language, but we present decidable combinations of interesting features." ;

We first investigate the complexity of the problem according to the fragments considered for SPARQL queries and for ShEx constraints. In particular, we show that the complexity of SPARQL query containment remains the same with or without ShEx constraints. We develop two radically different approaches for solving the problem and we evaluate them. The first approach relies on the joint use of a ShEx validator and a tool for checking query containment without constraints. In a second approach, we show how the problem can be solved by a reduction to a fragment of first-order logic with two variables. This alternative approach allows to take advantage of any of the many existing FOL theorem provers in this context. We evaluate how the two approaches compare experimentally, and report on lessons learned. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing SPARQL query containment in the presence of ShEx constraints." ;

        :hasAbstract    "Over the past several years, the popularity of the World Wide Web (WWW) has steadily increased. Unfortunately, as a result of over-loaded servers and lack of bandwidth between clients and servers, response times observed by end users have also steadily increased. Response times are often so unbearable that the popular press has relabeled the \"World Wide Web\" the \"World Wide Wait\". In this paper, we propose the use of content negotiation to allow clients and servers to tune response times to meet user demands. In our system, a client can negotiate content to match the bandwidth available between the server and itself. Clients obtain information about the available bandwidth from a SPAND performance predic-tion server [10]. When the available bandwidth is low or the origi-nal page is large, the client requests a smaller version of the document to reduce the response time. Our experiments show that the client is able to identify the subset of transfers that will perform poorly and that transferring a smaller amount of information on these connections helps improve the overall response time. In our system, servers that are limited by the bandwidth leaving their site reduce the quality and thereby the size of the documents being transferred. This allows the servers to serve many more requests when they are under heavy load. Our measurements show that the benefits can be significant, but are very dependent on the ratio of negotiable to non-negotiable content. For example, in a typical mix of 60% image or other negotiable content, a server can increase the number of requests it handles by 50%. When 90% of the content is negotiable, a fourfold increase in Web server throughput is possi-ble." ;

Using a number of case studies that include digital scholarly editing, 3D museum artifacts and sensor data streams, we evaluate the OA model‚Äôs capabilities. We also describe our implementation of an online annotation server that supports the storage, search and retrieval of OA-compliant annotations across multiple applications and disciplines.

However, the vast majority of web services consume and expose non-RDF data, and it is unlikely that all these services be converted to RDF one day. This is especially true for sensors and other devices in the Web of Things, as most RDF formats are verbose while constrained devices prefer to consume and expose data in concise formats. In this paper, we propose an approach to make these services and things reach semantic interoperability, while letting them the freedom to use their preferred formats. Our approach is rooted in the Web's architectural principles and the linked data principles, and relies on the definition of RDF presentations, which describe the link between RDF graphs and their representations. We introduce the RDF Presentation ontology (RDFP) that can be used to model inputs and outputs of procedures of the new Semantic Sensor Network ontology (SOSA/SSN), and input-Data and output Data of interaction patterns of things in the W3C WoT Thing Description ontology. We then propose practical solutions for web agents to be able to discover how a message content can be interpreted as RDF, generated from RDF, or validated, with different Web interaction protocols." ;

      >When content negotiation preferences are sent by the user agent in a
      request to encourage an algorithm located at the server to select the
      preferred representation, it is called
      <b>proactive negotiation</b> (a.k.a., server-driven negotiation).
      Selection is based on the available representations for a response (the
      dimensions over which it might vary, such as language, content-coding,
      etc.) compared to various information supplied in the request.

                It is difficult to describe the algorithm to the client to make
                a selection.
              </li>
              <li>
                The server avoids the back and forth because the client sends
                the preferences to the server which makes its best guess and
                sends them with the answer.

              <li>
                It is impossible for the server to accurately determine what
                might be "best" for any given user, since that would require
                complete knowledge of both the capabilities of the user agent
                and the intended use for the response.
              </li>
              <li>
                Having the user agent describe its capabilities in every request
                can be both very inefficient (given that only a small percentage
                of responses have multiple representations) and a potential risk
                to the user's privacy.
              </li>
              <li>
                It complicates the implementation of an origin server and the
                algorithms for generating responses to a request.
              </li>
              <li>
                It limits the reusability of responses for shared caching.
